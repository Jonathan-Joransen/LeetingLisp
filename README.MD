## Leeting Lisp
This is a collection of leet code question completed in common lisp.

I worked and these and compared my solutions to [this repo](https://github.com/rrcgat/LeetCode/blob/master/common-lisp/).

I solved most of these in a different way and found it helpful to review someone elses solutions to while learning lisp.
Hopefully this repo can serve the same purpose for you.
