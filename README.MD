## Leeting Lisp
This is a collection of leet code question completed in common lisp.

I originally worked on these while comparing my solutions to the ones in [this repo](https://github.com/rrcgat/LeetCode/blob/master/common-lisp/).

I found it helpful to review Carl's solutions while learning lisp.
Often he solved the same problems with different techniques exposing me to more patterns faster.

Hopefully this repo can serve the same purpose for you.
